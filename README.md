## Version 8.0 (Option A Web Deployment)

The Version 8.0 directory contains the focused “Option A” sub-variant plan for a web-based deployment using a local elevated agent plus a web UI/backend, along with an initial scaffolding layout for the build.
See the dedicated overview in `Version 8.0/OPTION_A_WEB_DEPLOYMENT.md` for scope, component responsibilities, and a proposed refactor plan.
